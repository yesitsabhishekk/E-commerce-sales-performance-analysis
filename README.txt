E-Commerce Sales Performance Analysis: Customer Segmentation and Lifetime Value
This project analyzes e-commerce sales data to identify and segment the most valuable customers, providing actionable insights to drive targeted marketing strategies and increase customer lifetime value.

1. Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to answer the question:
"How can we segment our customer base to identify our most valuable customers and develop targeted strategies to increase customer lifetime value?"

2. Methodology & Key Metrics
The analysis is based on a Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model, a proven method for customer segmentation. Key metrics calculated include:
Recency: The number of days since a customer's last purchase.
Frequency: The total number of purchases a customer has made.
Monetary: The total amount of money a customer has spent.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): A simplified calculation to estimate the total value a customer will bring to the business over their lifetime.

3. Tools
SQL (MySQL): Used for initial data aggregation and calculating RFM metrics from the raw sales data.
Excel: Utilized for data cleaning, creating RFM scores, segmenting customers, and summarizing the results with Pivot Tables.
Power BI: Employed for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the key findings and recommendations.

4. Key Findings
The "Champions" segment represents a small percentage of the total customer base but contributes a disproportionately high percentage of total revenue.
A significant portion of customers are classified as "At-Risk", indicating a need for re-engagement strategies.
The most valuable customers in terms of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores are concentrated in specific geographic regions.

5. Business Recommendations
Target the 'Champions': Implement a loyalty program or exclusive offers to retain the most valuable customers.
Re-engage 'At-Risk' Customers: Launch a targeted email or social media campaign with personalized discounts to bring them back.
Invest in Top Markets: Focus marketing and sales efforts on the countries identified as top performers.
